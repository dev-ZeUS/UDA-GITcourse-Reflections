What happens when you initialize a REPOsitory? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Initializing a git REPOsitory creates a hidden directory (.git) which stores metadata about 
	history of changes made ti files in the REPOsitory. Git is a VCS, it does version controlling 
	through REPOsitories so "git init"/initializing REPOsitory is the first step of version 
	controlling.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the REPOsitory? What value do you think it offers?
	
	WD(Working Directory) is the directory user works on where files are manipulated as needed, REPO (Repository) is
	a directory/storage where files are tracked for changes. SA (Staging Area) is  the place inbetween WD and REPO where 
	files are taken from WD and prepared in SA to be commited later in the REPO.
