When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	In order to collborate with multiple individuals simultaneously on big project from 
	different  lcoation.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Just to be on the safe side, manually pulling changes will keep the local machine updated.
