When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	In order to collborate with multiple individuals simultaneously on big project from 
	different  lcoation.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Just to be on the safe side, manually pulling changes will keep the local machine updated.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are used in case of copying a repo from another users GitHub Acc. into my own GitHub Acc. 
	Clones are used in case of cloning any repo on an users GitHub Acc into my local machine.
	Branches are used in a repo in case of experimental changes or addition/removal new/old features.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	Remotes are used for the purpose of collaboration, so in case that while collaborating anything don't 
	get changed in a unwanted way it is safer to store a local copy.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without tools such as Git & GitHub I would have to use manual options like file sharing (Dropbox, Google Drive).
	Manual options owuld be ahrder as I have to do all the changes, keeping track of them manually while in case of Git/GitHub
	most of the tasks are done automatically by GitHub.
